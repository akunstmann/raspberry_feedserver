# raspberry_feedserver
RSS feed generator on raspberry pi for feeding a panic status board on ios

This example shows how to download, parse and convert to rss a specific page of a website.
Framework can be extended by additional leto modules (leto = load, extract, transform, output).

Be careful about the terms of use of the website you load. Automatic reading might be forbidden. Be even more careful about the distribution of your RSS to non-private networks. Redistribution of content is probably forbidden. Do not flood websites with requests. 

Requirements
* Python3
* install Beautifulsoup first (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* copy one of the ico files to favicon.ico

How to use
* Run feedserver_main
* Adjust times, trains and stations in leto_bahn.rss to your needs (german railway)
* Adjust highway names in auto.rss to your needs (works probably only for the south-west of germany)
* Websites are changing frequently, so you probably have to adjust the html parsing code 
* Check the results in the browser http://localhost:8080/auto.rss and http://localhost:8080/bahn.rss
* Customize the panic status board on your ipad with a rss feed panel and let it point to your RSS machine. Use ip instead of "localhost" in url.
